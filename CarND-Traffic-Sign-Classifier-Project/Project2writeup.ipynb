    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because it is simple to work on a plane of image data (e.g., a single color channel) at a time. Grayscale images only contain one image plane (containing the gray scale intensity values). Another point is data reduction. If you converted this image to gray scale you would only need to process 1/3 of the data compared to the color image (RGB).  However, you also lose information (e.g., color information). For many image processing applications color is very important, and converting to gray scale can worsen results. At this point, I will go for this pre-processing technique. Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.\n",

    "As a last step, I normalized the image data because in the process of training our network, we're going to be multiplying (weights) and adding to (biases) these initial inputs in order to cause activations that we then backpropogate with the gradients to train the model. If we didn't scale our input training vectors, the ranges of our distributions of feature values would likely be different for each feature, and thus the learning rate would cause corrections in each dimension that would differ from one another. We might be over compensating a correction in one weight dimension while undercompensating in another.\n",
